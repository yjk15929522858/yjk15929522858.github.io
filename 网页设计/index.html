            <h3>The Avengers</h3>
            <p>

A sudden powerful force emerged from the cosmic cube and brought the evil god rocky (Tom hidleston). He took the cosmic cube and destroyed the experimental site, which caught the "Divine Shield bureau" unprepared, which has been committed to protecting global security for a long time. Commander "one eyed man" Nick Frey (Samuel L. Jackson) realizes that he must create a "strongest alliance in history" and assemble all kinds of superheroes in order to save the world.
<br>
So there are six superheroes - "Iron Man" Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), "Thor" Sol odinson (Chris Hemsworth), "Captain America" Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), "Hulk" Bruce Banner (mark rufaro) The "Avenger alliance" formed by "black widow" Natasha Romanov (Scarlett Johnson) and "eagle eye" Clint Barton (Jeremy Reiner) came into being.

      <h3>Avengers: Age of Ultron</h3>
      <p>

The battle hardened superheroes developed job burnout. Tony Stark, who had already taken off his armor, invented "aochuang" (James Spade) - an artificial intelligence robot with self-awareness and learning ability, and entrusted the task of commanding the robot corps to aochuang.
<br>
To the surprise of the superheroes, the evolving aochuang came to the conclusion that "human beings are the greatest threat on earth", and then began to implement the plan to eliminate human beings. The powerful reformers Maximov, brother and sister "fast silver" Pietro (Aaron Taylor Johnson) and "Scarlet Witch" Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) have also become altron's helpers and caused trouble everywhere. The Avengers must gather again to solve the crisis created by themselves; Finally, aochuang was completely eliminated, and the Avengers welcomed Falcon (Anthony McKay), illusion (Paul betani), war machine (don Chandler), and crimson witch.

      <p>Mieba (Josh Brolin), the supreme power in the galaxy, takes four Obsidian generals around to collect the whereabouts of infinite gemstones. Once mieba gets six infinite gemstones, one of his snap fingers can completely destroy half of the life of the whole universe.
<br>
In order to protect the universe, Tony Stark and Steve Rogers reorganized their respective Avengers and fought with spider man (Tom Hollande), Dr. strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), King (Benedict king), Galaxy guard, panther (Chadwick Bosman) and the kingdom of wakanda at all costs to prevent mieba from collecting unlimited gems; However, mieba finally succeeded in collecting six infinite gemstones and randomly erasing half of the life of the whole universe.</p>

<br>
The universe was devastated by the action to destroy hegemony, but five years later, the ant man (Paul Luther) who returned to the real world from the quantum field brought hope of reversal to the surviving Avengers. No matter what the consequences ahead will be, the surviving Avengers must gather again with the help of all remaining allies to reverse the actions of eliminating hegemony, completely restore the order of the universe, re create hope and restore the vitality of the universe; Finally, Tony Stark died heroically, but the universe was successfully revived; After the battle, Steve Rogers officially withdrew from the Avengers and handed over the position and shield of "Captain America" to the Falcon</p>

      <h2>Some representative film reviews</h2>
      <p>"Avengers 2" has the problem that most All-Star films will face, that is, there are too many roles, but the film duration is very short. The director hopes to take care of every star and role and give everyone enough appearance time and performance, but in fact, it is often counterproductive. In the action scene, the film still has some experience and continues the experience of the first film. At the beginning of the film, a special effect long motion lens is used to show the group of multiple superheroes in an all-round way. It is connected by a long lens, which is very smooth and enjoyable. (1905 film online review)</p>
      <p>"Avengers 3: Infinite War" is the most superhero Marvel film in history. The unprecedented gathering of 23 superheroes excited all the audience. The strongest villain in the history of Marvel film "mieba" has provided an impressive performance for the audience on the big screen with a sense of madness and oppression that subverts the imagination. (Sina entertainment review)</p>
      <p>In the whole film, the information content of several big plays is full and the rhythm is very fast. Whether it is the massive action scenes, dazzling special effects scenes, or extremely compact plot development, it constantly stimulates the audience's heart, and the whole process of information bombing is full of high energy. The director Russell brothers still focused on the literary drama, and said goodbye to the audience affectionately, even tragically. The film has become an epic classic. (Guangzhou Daily)</p>

He was originally a thin young Steve Rogers. He underwent super soldier transformation surgery and became the only successful experiment. His physical quality reached the human limit. He has no real super power. Although he uses an indestructible special shield, his biggest weapon is courage, perseverance and patriotism. On the eve of the end of World War II, he fell asleep in the ice sea and was found by modern heroes decades later. The awakened Rogers continues to fight for justice, but the contemporary world is not as clear as it used to be. From time to time, he is regarded as a living fossil behind the times. As one of Marvel's few heroes who are almost moral perfect!</p>

      <h2>Some discussions about the Avengers </h2>
      <p>How did Thanos die? Was it killed by Thor or by iron man? Because Thanos who was killed by Thor came here and was killed by iron man, did Thor kill mieba?   (Chinese netizen ----- "weirdo")</p>
      <br>
      <p>Has that half disappeared? Or is it because mieba shuttled to the present before hitting his finger and was killed? Has half of his previous life disappeared??  (American netizen ------ "amateur magician")</p>
      <br>
      <p>There's a question. Didn't the Captain America in the Avengers raise the hammer for the first time because of Thor's face (said by the director of the Avengers in an interview)? Why did someone say today that the United States team was unable to lift it because of its distractions at that time?  (Korean netizen ----- dreamer)</p>
